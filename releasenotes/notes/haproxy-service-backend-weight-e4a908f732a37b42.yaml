    The haproxy-config role now allows user to set weight per
    haproxy's backend. This can be achieved by setting a hostvar
    ``haproxy_{{ service }}_weight`` in inventory file to any integer
    value in range from 1 to 256, so the higher the weight, the higher
    the load. This can be set per ``{{ service }}``. If hostvar is not
    specified, backend's weight is not rendered in final haproxy
    configuration.
