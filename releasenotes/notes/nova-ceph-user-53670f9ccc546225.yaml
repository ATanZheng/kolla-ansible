fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue with default Nova configuration for Ceph where the RBD user
    is set to ``nova``, but only a ``cinder`` keyring is copied. The default
    value of ``ceph_nova_user`` is changed to the value of
    ``ceph_cinder_user``, in line with the default for ``ceph_nova_keyring``.

upgrade:
  - |
    Modifies the default value of ``ceph_nova_user`` from ``nova`` to
    the value of ``ceph_cinder_user``, in line with the default for
    ``ceph_nova_keyring``.  Users who have overridden ``ceph_nova_keyring`` to
    use separate keyrings for Nova and Cinder should also override
    ``ceph_nova_user`` to match the Nova keyring. `LP#1934145
