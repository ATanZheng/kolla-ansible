    Fixes an issue where RabbitMQ was configured to mirror classic transient
    queues for all services. According to the RabbitMQ documentation this is
    not a supported configuration, and contributed to numerous bug reports.
    In order to avoid making unexpected changes to the RabbitMQ cluster, it is
    necessary to set ``rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy`` to ``yes`` in order to
    apply this fix.  This variable will be removed in the Yoga release.
