features:

    Adds support for passing extra runtime options to cAdvisor via
    ``prometheus_cadvisor_cmdline_extras`` new variable. By default
    system cgroups' metrics are disabled, plus container labels
    don't get exposed to Prometheus. Expensive metrics that usually
    should not be exported are also enforced to be disabled - consult
    `<https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/docs/runtime_options.md#metrics>`_
    for a list. These defaults create savings in resources usage by both
    cAdvisor and Prometheus.
upgrade:
  - |
    cAdvisor has now reduced number of Prometheus metrics and labels
    exported by default. This means that corresponding timeseries will
    no longer be created. If existing setup relies on these, e.g. for
    visualisation or alerting, they could be explicitly enabled prior to
    upgrading with the ``prometheus_cadvisor_cmdline_extras`` new variable.
    Reference for the possible options: `<https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/docs/runtime_options.md#metrics>`_.
