    With this release, kolla-ansible no longer creates admin endpoints for any
    service other than Keystone. Existing endpoints will not be removed
    automatically, if you want to clean up your existing cloud, you can use a
    command like::

        openstack endpoint list --interface admin -f value | \
        awk '!/keystone/ {print $1}' | xargs openstack endpoint delete
