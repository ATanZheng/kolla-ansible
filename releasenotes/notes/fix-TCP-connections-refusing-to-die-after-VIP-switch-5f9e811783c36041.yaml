    Added a new haproxy configuration variable,
    ``haproxy_host_ipv4_tcp_retries2``,
    which allows users to modify this kernel option.
    This option sets maximum number of times a TCP packet is retransmitted
    in established state before giving up. The default kernel value is 15,
    which corresponds to a duration of approximately between 13 to 30
    minutes, depending on the retransmission timeout. This variable can be used
    to mitigate an issue with stuck connections in case of VIP failover,
    see `bug 1917068 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1917068>`__
    for details.
