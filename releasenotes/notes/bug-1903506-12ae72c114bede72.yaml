    Add ``octavia-driver-agent`` to ``Octavia`` deployments to allow for
    additional providers, e.g. ``ovn-octavia-provider``. It is automatically
    deployed when ``Octavia`` is enabled and ``neutron_plugin_agent`` is set
    to ``ovn``. It can be also enabled by setting
    ``enable_octavia_driver_agent`` to ``yes``.
