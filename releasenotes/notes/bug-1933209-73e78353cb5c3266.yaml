    Fixes default Masakari host monitor config to work with other config that
    Kolla Ansible sets.
    This sets ``disable_ipmi_check`` due to ``restrict_to_remotes`` being set.
    It prevents the ``TypeError`` that happened when host monitor had to
    take action.
    This does not affect any functionality so far as Kolla Ansible does not
    manage IPMI credentials in Pacemaker.
