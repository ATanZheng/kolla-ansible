    Adds two new variables ``service_images_pull_retries`` and
    ``service_images_pull_delay`` which control the behaviour of image
    pulling tasks. These are useful if your registry is not 100%
    reliable (usually due to load). The defaults have been set to
    3 retries and 5 seconds delay to ensure a better default experience
    (these are actually Ansible defaults when task retries are enabled).
