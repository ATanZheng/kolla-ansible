    Adds a new flag, ``docker_disable_default_network``, which
    defaults to ``no``. Docker is using ``172.17.0.0/16`` by default for bridge
    networking on ``docker0``, and this might cause routing problems for
    operator networks. Setting this flag to ``yes`` will disable Docker's
    bridge networking. This feature will be enabled by default from the
    Wallaby 12.0.0 release.
