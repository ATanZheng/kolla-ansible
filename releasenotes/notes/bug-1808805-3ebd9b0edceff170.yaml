    Fixes monasca-thresh to correctly submit the topology to Storm.
    The previous container ran the topology in local mode (within the
    container), and didn't  use the Storm cloud.  The new container
    handles submitting the topology to Storm and also handles killing
    and replaces the topology when it's configuration has changed.
    As a result, the monasca-thresh container is only used for
    submission, and exits after that's completed.
    The logs for the topology will now be available in the storm
    worker-artifact logs.
