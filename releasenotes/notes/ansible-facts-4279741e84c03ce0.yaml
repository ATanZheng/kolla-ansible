    Updates all references to Ansible facts within Kolla Ansible from using
    individual fact variables to using the items in the ``ansible_facts``
    dictionary. This allows users to disable `fact variable injection
    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#inject-facts-as-vars>`__
    in their Ansible configuration, which may provide some performance
    improvement. Check for facts referenced in local configuration files, and
    update to use ``ansible_facts`` before disabling fact variable injection.
