    Adds support for automatic generation of certificates for Octavia via the
    ``kolla-ansible octavia-certificates`` command.
upgrade:
  - |
    Resources required for Octavia are now registered automatically by
    default. Octavia users upgrading from Ussuri should set
    ``octavia_auto_configure`` to ``no`` in ``globals.yml`` to avoid
    registering conflicting resources.
