    Makes it possible to set HAProxy's ``timeout http-keep-alive`` via
    ``haproxy_http_keep_alive_timeout``. The default is 10s, like the
    previous default that applied via ``haproxy_http_request_timeout``.

upgrade:
  - |
    HAProxy's ``timeout http-keep-alive`` is now set via
    ``haproxy_http_keep_alive_timeout``. The default is 10s, like the
    previous default that applied via ``haproxy_http_request_timeout``,
    but the new variable does not follow the old one so might need customising
    if the former was customised for keep-alive purposes.
    Do note the two values do not have to have the same value and often do not.
    Please read the linked record for background.
