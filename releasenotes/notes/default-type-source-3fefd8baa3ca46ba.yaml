    Updates the default image type to ``source``. Users wishing to deploy
    ``binary`` type images should set ``kolla_install_type`` to ``binary`` in
    ``globals.yml``. This change is to reflect the reality that source images
    are tested more thoroughly and we (as OpenStack community) have better
    control over them.
