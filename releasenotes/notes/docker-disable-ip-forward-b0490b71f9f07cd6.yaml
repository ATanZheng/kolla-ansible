fixes:
  - |
    Adds a new flag, ``docker_disable_ip_forward``, which
    defaults to ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules`` and is used to
    disable docker's ``ip-forward`` option which makes docker set
    ``net.ipv4.ip_forward`` sysctl to ``1``.
    This is to protect from creating all-forwarding hosts.

    Adds a new flag, ``docker_disable_ip_forward``, which
    defaults to ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules`` and is used to
    disable docker's ``ip-forward`` option which makes docker set
    ``net.ipv4.ip_forward`` sysctl to ``1``. By default,
    ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules`` is ``true``, in which case
    docker's ``ip-forward`` option is ``disabled``.

    For existing hosts, this configuration change is applied when configuring
    docker via ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers``. Docker changes the sysctl
    in a non-persistent manner, so it will revert to the default of ``0`` after
    a reboot, if not configured elsewhere. This should not cause a problem,
    since Kolla Ansible applies the sysctl where necessary. Operators may wish
    to perform a proactive reboot, or apply the default through other means.
