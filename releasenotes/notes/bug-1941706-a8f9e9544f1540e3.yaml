    Fixes a critical bug which caused Nova instances (VMs) using libvirtd
    (the default/usual choice) to get killed on libvirtd (``nova_libvirt``)
    container stop (and thus any restart - either manual or done by running
    Kolla Ansible). It was affecting Wallaby+ on CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian
    Buster (not Bullseye). If your deployment is also affected, please read the
    referenced Launchpad bug report, comment #22, for how to fix it without
    risking data loss. In short: fixing requires redeploying and this will
    trigger the bug so one has to first migrate important VMs away and only
    then redeploy empty compute nodes.
