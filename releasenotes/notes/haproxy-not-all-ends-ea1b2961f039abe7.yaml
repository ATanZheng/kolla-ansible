    (internal/advanced) Adds support for ``with_frontend`` and ``with_backend``
    to haproxy service definitions. These new fields preserve the old logic
    by defaulting to ``true`` but can be set to ``false`` to make the selected
    service not configure the respective "end".
    This requires ``haproxy_service_template`` to be set to
    ``haproxy_single_service_split.cfg.j2`` which is the new default.
