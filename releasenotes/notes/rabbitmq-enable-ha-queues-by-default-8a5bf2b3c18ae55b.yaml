upgrade:
  - |
    The variable ``om_enable_rabbitmq_high_availability`` is now set to
    ``True`` by default. An upgrade will therefore require some manual steps to
    migrate from transient to durable queues. Note that this will be caught by
    a precheck.

    See docs for details:
    https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/zed/reference/message-queues/rabbitmq.html#high-availability
