upgrade:
  - |
    Support for deploying ``kafka``, ``storm`` and ``zookeeper`` have been
    dropped since they have been used only with Monasca. Post-upgrade cleanup
    of those services can be done using ``kolla-ansible monasca_cleanup`` - for
    details please see
    `Monasca guide <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/zed/reference/logging-and-monitoring/monasca-guide.html>`__
