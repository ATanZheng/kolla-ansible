upgrade:
  - |
    The default of ``haproxy_service_template`` changed to
    ``haproxy_single_service_split.cfg.j2``.
    This template allows more flexibility in service config.
    The previously-default ``haproxy_single_service_listen.cfg.j2`` is now
    deprecated for removal.
    No action needs to be taken unless one relied on replacing the previous
    default template contents with one's own (under the same name).

    flexibility in service config.
