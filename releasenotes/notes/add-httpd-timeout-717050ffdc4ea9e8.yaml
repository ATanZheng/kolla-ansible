    Adds configuration parameter ``kolla_httpd_timeout`` to configure the
    ``TimeOut`` directive for services that use Apache HTTP server to
    handle HTTP requests. The default value is 60 seconds which matches
    the original default, but you may wish to increase this.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where it was not easily possible to set the Apache
    HTTP timeout directive, where the default of 60s would cause
    problems in slow running services. See
    `LP#1917648 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1917648>`__.
