    The Mariadb role now allows the creation of multiple clusters.  This
    provides a benefit to operators as they are able to install and maintain
    several clusters at once using kolla-ansible.  This is useful when
    deploying database clusters for cells or database clusters for services
    that have large demands on the database.
