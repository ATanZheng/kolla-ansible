    On slower nodes, the initial grafana startup could experience a
    timeout failure when the migrations for setting up the database
    took longer than expected. This has been fixed by increasing the
    default timeout. The timeout settings can be changed via new
    parameters ``grafana_start_first_node_delay`` and
    ``grafana_start_first_node_retries`` for the ``grafana`` role.
