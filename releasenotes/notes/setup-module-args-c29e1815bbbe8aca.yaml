    Adds support for configuring the ``filter`` and ``gather_subset`` arguments
    for the ``setup`` module via ``kolla_ansible_setup_filter`` and
    ``kolla_ansible_setup_gather_subset`` respectively. These can be used to
    reduce the number of facts, which can have a significant effect on
    performance of Ansible.
