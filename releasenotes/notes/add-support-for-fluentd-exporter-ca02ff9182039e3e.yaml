    Adds support for integrating Fluentd metrics into Prometheus. By
    default this is now enabled when Prometheus is enabled. This behaviour
    can be overridden via the `enable_prometheus_fluentd_integration` flag. By
    default the integration provides metrics relating to the processing of logs
    by Fluentd. These metrics can be useful for monitoring the status of the
    Fluentd service. Additional metrics can also be extracted from logs via
    custom Fluentd config.
