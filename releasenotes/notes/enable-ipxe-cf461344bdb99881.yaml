    An HTTP server is now always deployed for Ironic conductor, while
    previously it was only deployed when iPXE is enabled.

    In the Wallaby release, Ironic changed the default deploy driver from
    iSCSI to direct. In the Xena release, Ironic removed the iSCSI driver.
    The recommended deploy driver is ``direct``, which uses HTTP to
    transfer the disk image.
    This requires an HTTP server, and the simplest option is to use the one
    previously deployed when ``enable_ironic_ipxe`` is set to ``true``.
