    Implements container healthchecks for core OpenStack services. Docker
    healthchecks are periodically called scripts that check health of a
    running service that expose health information in ``docker ps`` output
    and trigger a ``health_status event``. Healthchecks are now enabled
    by default and can be disabled by setting
    ``enable_container_healthchecks`` to ``no`` in ``globals.yml``.
