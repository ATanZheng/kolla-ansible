    Fixes ``br_netfilter`` kernel module not to be loaded nor configured
    by Kolla Ansible.
    It was loaded and configured on Nova compute hosts regardless of the
    networking service config and its requirements.
    Users of existing setups are advised to re-evaluate whether they
    need this module loaded and unload if not necessary (also: remove
    from the autoloaded modules, as well as remove the related sysctls
    ``net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-*``).
    Kolla Ansible will simply no longer try to load nor configure this
    module at all.
    Neutron agents handle loading and configuring this module as
    necessary.
