  - |
    Docker iptables manipulation and bridge networking are now disabled by
    default. This avoids problems that may be caused by Docker settings the
    default policy of the ``FORWARD`` chain in the ``filter`` table to
    ``DROP``. To revert to the previous behaviour, set
    ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules`` to ``no``. This sets the default
    of ``docker_disable_default_network``.
