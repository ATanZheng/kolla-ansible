    Adds ``ovn-monitor-all`` variable. A boolean value that tells if
    ovn-controller should unconditionally monitor all records in OVS
    databases.
    Setting ``ovn-monitor-all`` variable to 'true' will remove some CPU
    load from OVN SouthBound DB but will effect with more updates
    comming to ovn-controller. Might be helpfull in large deployments
    with many compute hosts.
