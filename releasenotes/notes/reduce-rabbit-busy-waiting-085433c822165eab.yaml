    Fixes an issue where RabbitMQ consumes a large amount of CPU, particularly
    on multi-core systems.  The default RabbitMQ tuning assumes that RabbitMQ
    is running on a dedicated host, which is the opposite of a typical Kolla
    Ansible container setup.  For more details on tuning RabbitMQ in your
    environment, please see: https://www.rabbitmq.com/runtime.html#busy-waiting

    Modifies the default value of ``rabbitmq_server_additional_erl_args`` from
    an empty string to ``+S 2:2 +sbwt none +sbwtdcpu none +sbwtdio none``.
