features:
  - |
    Adds "manila_cephfs_filesystem_name" variable to support multi-fs
    Ceph Pacific+ deloyments.
fixes:
  - |
    Removes "fix_cephfs_owner.yaml" which related to pre-wallaby Manila's
    use of subfolders. Post-wallaby Manila now uses cephfs volumes instead,
    as such this file is no longer required.
