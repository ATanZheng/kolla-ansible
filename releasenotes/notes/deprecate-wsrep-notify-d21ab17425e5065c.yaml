deprecations:
  - |
    The ``wsrep-notify.sh`` script used for disabling ``haproxy`` user when
    node is not ready for accepting connections in deployments without
    ``mariadb-clustercheck`` is deprecated and will be removed in Xena
    release. It has been unreliable and the recommended (enabled by default)
    approach is to deploy ``mariadb-clustercheck``.
