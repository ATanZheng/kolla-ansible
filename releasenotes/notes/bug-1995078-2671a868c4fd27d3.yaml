    Fixes ``ovn-chassis-mac-mappings`` missing on network nodes.
    Previously ``ovn-chassis-mac-mappings`` has been added only to
    ``ovn-controller-compute`` group. However external ports are being
    scheduled on network nodes. Adding ``ovn-chassis-mac-mappings``
    on whole ``ovn-controller`` group fixes the bug.
