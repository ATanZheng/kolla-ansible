upgrade:

    Switches default images source (``docker_registry``) to ``quay.io``.
    The ``docker_namespace`` is also changed to ``openstack.kolla`` to match.
    This is to make the default experience better, especially for users in
    China, those deploying more than once and/or beyond the all-in-one (AIO)
    environment used for development, testing and evaluation.
    Do note for multinode and production deployments it is still recommended
    to use a local registry as docs suggest.
