upgrade:
  - |
    Support for Zun for this release has been provisionally dropped. This is
    due to a number of base dependencies that require updating. The Zun images
    remain buildable, and the roles have not been removed, but a precheck
    has been added to prevent breaking current deployments.

    Operators are strongly encouraged to hold off upgrading if Zun is a
    requirement. Please also consult the deprecation notes.
deprecations:
  - |
    Zun is currently provisionally deprecated but not removed. If Zun regains
    compatibility within the next release cycle, backports to this version of
    Kolla and Kolla-Ansible will be considered to provide a smooth upgrade
    path.
