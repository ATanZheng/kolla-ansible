upgrade:
  - |
    Due to deprecation, ``chrony`` is no longer enabled by default.  To enable
    it, set ``enable_chrony`` to ``true``.

    If disabled, the container and configuration may be removed by running
    ``kolla-ansible chrony-cleanup``.

    The ``kolla-ansible prechecks`` command will fail if Chrony is disabled and
    the container is running. It will also fail if Chrony is disabled and no
    host NTP daemon is detected. This check may be disabled by setting
    ``prechecks_enable_host_ntp_checks`` to ``false`` if using an NTP daemon
    other than chrony, ntpd or systemd-timesyncd.
