    Since Ussuri, there is a bug in how Ceph (RBD) is handled with Cinder:
    the ``backend_host`` option is missing from the generated configuration
    for external Ceph. The symptoms are that volumes become unmanageable
    until extra admin action is taken. This does *not* affect the data plane
    - running virtual machines are *not* affected.

    There is a related issue regarding active-active ``cinder-volume``
    services (single-host ``cinder-volume`` *not* affected), which is that
    they should not have been configured with ``backend_host`` in the first
    place but with ``cluster`` and proper coordination instead. Some users
    might have customised their config already to address this issue.

    The Kolla team is investigating the best way to address this for all its
    users. In the meantime, please ensure that, before upgrading to Ussuri,
    the ``backend_host`` option is set to its previous value (the default was
    ``rbd:volumes``) via a config override.

    For more details please refer to the referenced bug.
    Do note this issue affects both new deployments and upgrades.
