Supported Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kolla Ansible supports the following host Operating Systems (OS):

.. note::

   CentOS 7 is no longer supported as a host OS. The Train release supports
   both CentOS 7 and 8, and provides a route for migration. See the `Kolla
   Ansible Train documentation
   <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/train/user/centos8.html>`_ for
   information on migrating to CentOS 8.

* CentOS 8
* Debian Buster (10)
* RHEL 8
* Ubuntu Bionic (18.04)

Supported container images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For best results, the base container image distribution should match the host
OS distribution. The following values are supported for ``kolla_base_distro``:

* ``centos``
* ``debian``
* ``rhel``
* ``ubuntu``

For details of which images are supported on which distributions, see the
:kolla-doc:`Kolla support matrix <support_matrix>`.
