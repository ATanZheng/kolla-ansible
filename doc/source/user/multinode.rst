Multinode Deployment of Kolla
=============================

.. _deploy_a_registry:

Deploy a registry
=================

A Docker registry is a locally hosted registry that replaces the need to pull
from the Docker Hub to get images. Kolla can function with or without a local
registry, however for a multinode deployment some type of registry is
mandatory.  Only one registry must be deployed, although HA features exist for
registry services.

The Docker registry prior to version 2.3 has extremely bad performance because
all container data is pushed for every image rather than taking advantage of
Docker layering to optimize push operations. For more information reference
`pokey registry <https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14018>`__.

Edit the ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml`` and add the following where 192.168.1.100
is the IP address of the machine and 5000 is the port where the registry is
currently running:

.. code-block:: yaml

   docker_registry: 192.168.1.100:5000

The Kolla community recommends using registry 2.3 or later. To deploy registry
with version 2.3 or later, do the following:

.. code-block:: console

   cd kolla
   tools/start-registry

The Docker registry can be configured as a pull through cache to proxy the
official Kolla images hosted in Docker Hub. In order to configure the local
registry as a pull through cache, in the host machine set the environment
variable ``REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL`` to the URL for the repository on
Docker Hub.

.. code-block:: console

   export REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL=https://registry-1.docker.io

.. note::

   Pushing to a registry configured as a pull-through cache is unsupported.
   For more information, Reference the `Docker Documentation
   <https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/>`__.

.. _configure_docker_all_nodes:

Configure Docker on all nodes
=============================

.. note::

   As the subtitle for this section implies, these steps should be
   applied to all nodes, not just the deployment node.

After starting the registry, it is necessary to instruct Docker that
it will be communicating with an insecure registry.
For example, To enable insecure registry communication,
modify the ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` file to contain the following where
``192.168.1.100`` is the IP address of the machine where the registry
is currently running:

.. path /etc/docker/daemon.json
.. code-block:: json

   {
     "insecure-registries" : ["192.168.1.100:5000"]
   }

Restart Docker by executing the following commands:

For CentOS or Ubuntu with systemd:

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl restart docker

For Ubuntu with upstart or sysvinit:

.. code-block:: console

   service docker restart

.. _edit-inventory:

Edit the Inventory File
=======================

The ansible inventory file contains all the information needed to determine
what services will land on which hosts. Edit the inventory file in the
Kolla Ansible directory ``ansible/inventory/multinode``. If Kolla Ansible
was installed with pip, it can be found in ``/usr/share/kolla-ansible``.

Add the IP addresses or hostnames to a group and the services associated with
that group will land on that host. IP addresses or hostnames must be added to
the groups control, network, compute, monitoring and storage. Also, define
additional behavioral inventory parameters such as ``ansible_ssh_user``,
``ansible_become`` and ``ansible_private_key_file/ansible_ssh_pass`` which
controls how ansible interacts with remote hosts.

.. note::

   Ansible uses SSH to connect the deployment host and target hosts. For more
   information about SSH authentication please reference
   `Ansible documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html>`__.

.. code-block:: ini

   # These initial groups are the only groups required to be modified. The
   # additional groups are for more control of the environment.
   [control]
   # These hostname must be resolvable from your deployment host
   control01      ansible_ssh_user=<ssh-username> ansible_become=True ansible_private_key_file=<path/to/private-key-file>
   192.168.122.24 ansible_ssh_user=<ssh-username> ansible_become=True ansible_private_key_file=<path/to/private-key-file>

.. note::

   Additional inventory parameters might be required according to your
   environment setup. Reference `Ansible Documentation
   <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html>`__ for more
   information.


For more advanced roles, the operator can edit which services will be
associated in with each group. Keep in mind that some services have to be
grouped together and changing these around can break your deployment:

.. code-block:: ini

   [kibana:children]
   control

   [elasticsearch:children]
   control

   [haproxy:children]
   network

.. _multinode-host-and-group-variables:

Host and group variables
========================

Typically, Kolla Ansible configuration is stored in the ``globals.yml`` file.
Variables in this file apply to all hosts. In an environment with multiple
hosts, it may become necessary to have different values for variables for
different hosts. A common example of this is for network interface
configuration, e.g. ``api_interface``.

Ansible's host and group variables can be assigned in a `variety of ways
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html>`_.
Simplest is in the inventory file itself:

.. code-block:: ini

   # Host with a host variable.
   [control]
   control01 api_interface=eth3

   # Group with a group variable.
   [control:vars]
   api_interface=eth4

This can quickly start to become difficult to maintain, so it may be preferable
to use ``host_vars`` or ``group_vars`` directories containing YAML files with
host or group variables:

.. code-block:: console

   inventory/
     group_vars/
       control
     host_vars/
       control01
     multinode

`Ansible's variable precedence rules
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#ansible-variable-precedence>`__
are quite complex, but it is worth becoming familiar with them if using host
and group variables. The playbook group variables in
``ansible/group_vars/all.yml`` define global defaults, and these take
precedence over variables defined in an inventory file and inventory
``group_vars/all``, but not over inventory ``group_vars/*``. Variables in
'extra' files (``globals.yml``) have the highest precedence, so any variables
which must differ between hosts must not be in ``globals.yml``.

Deploying Kolla
===============

.. note::

    If there are multiple keepalived clusters running within the same layer 2
    network, edit the file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml`` and specify a
    ``keepalived_virtual_router_id``. The ``keepalived_virtual_router_id`` should
    be unique and belong to the range 0 to 255.

.. note::

   If glance is configured to use ``file`` as backend, only one ``glance_api``
   container will be started. ``file`` is enabled by default when no other
   backend is specified in ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.

First, check that the deployment targets are in a state where Kolla may deploy
to them:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-ansible prechecks -i <path/to/multinode/inventory/file>

.. note::

   RabbitMQ doesn't work with IP addresses, hence the IP address of
   ``api_interface`` should be resolvable by hostnames to make sure that all
   RabbitMQ Cluster hosts can resolve each others hostnames beforehand.

Run the deployment:

.. code-block:: console

   kolla-ansible deploy -i <path/to/multinode/inventory/file>
