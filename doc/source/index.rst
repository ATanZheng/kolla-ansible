=========================================
Welcome to Kolla Ansible's documentation!
=========================================

Kolla's mission is to provide production-ready containers and deployment tools
for operating OpenStack clouds.

Kolla Ansible is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with minimal experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack configuration to
suit the operator's exact requirements.
